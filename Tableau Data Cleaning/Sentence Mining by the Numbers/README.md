[Data](https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/J-K-Rowling-ebook/dp/B0192CTN72) from Harry Potter 1-7 by J.K. Rowling.

- The **Harry Potter** directory contains data related to the simulation.
- `functions.py` consists of helper functions used in the simulation.
- `#1 Create the Data Frames.ipynb` contains the initialdata cleaning process for the data.
- `#2 1T Simulations.ipynb` consists of the running of the simulation code.
- `#3 Analysis.ipynb` contains a brief version of the analysis found on Tableau.
- `requirements.txt` can be used to replicate the conda environment used for this project.

NOTE: Due to copyright, I cannot share any of the data relating to Harry Potter, so the **Harry Potter** directory will be missing data essential to the simulation.
